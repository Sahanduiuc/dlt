Lecture 1

# Data <=> fingerprint using hash functions
# simple to evaluate given data, very hard to do the inverse
#
# BlockChain is only one concept for Distritibuted Ledger Technology
#
# For today let's ignore distributed. How to make a ledger...
#
# Blocks of Data
#
# Fields time, transactions => hashcode
#
# If we now had a central "unit" keeping track of the hashcodes we would have achieved something interesting.
# Someone can monitor the state of our data without actually being aware of the content. We monitor the state of our hash values...
#
# Taking about hash collisions...

Lecture 2

We don't want a central unit, what if we link blocks, e.g. a block b is aware of the hash of its predecessor block a

Block a => Block b

We store them in a list... The first block in this list shall be the Genesis block (book of the bible)

If you change a Block all predecessors are lost... and the data is corrupt. Can not do that... You would have to regenerate a new hash key
for every element further down the road. This shall be expensive...

Birthday paradox


Lecture 3

How de make sure our data is consistent ... Consensus
How do we motivate people to participate ... People validate data and race for new blocks
